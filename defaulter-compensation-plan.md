# Defaulter Compensation Plan for Mid-Cycle

## Objective
Create a system to ensure that the next-in-line member receives their full payout amount when some members default on their contributions, by utilizing the community's backup fund.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Track Defaulters
- Update the defaulters array with the user IDs of members who didn't contribute
- This data will be used for penalty enforcement and to calculate the deficit amount

### 2. Calculate Contribution Deficit
- Determine how many members failed to contribute by comparing:
  - Total community members vs. members in the contributionsToNextInLine array
- Calculate the total deficit amount:
  ```
  deficitAmount = community.settings.minContribution * defaulters.length
  ```

### 3. Calculate Available Backup Fund
- Determine the amount of funds in the backup fund:
  ```
  backupFundAvailable = community.backupFund
  ```
- For reference, the backup fund is calculated based on:
  ```
  community.settings.backupFundPercentage
  ```

### 4. Determine Withdrawal Amount
- If backup fund is sufficient to cover the deficit:
  ```
  withdrawalAmount = deficitAmount
  ```
- If backup fund is insufficient:
  ```
  withdrawalAmount = backupFundAvailable
  ```

### 5. Adjust Payout and Backup Fund
- Decrease the backup fund by the withdrawal amount:
  ```
  community.backupFund -= withdrawalAmount
  ```
- Increase the payout amount by the withdrawal amount:
  ```
  MidCycle.payoutAmount += withdrawalAmount
  ```

### 6. Error Handling
- Log all transactions for audit purposes
- Handle edge cases:
  - What happens if the backup fund is completely depleted?
  - Should there be a minimum threshold for the backup fund?

### 7. Integration Points
- This functionality should be implemented in the existing handleUnreadyMidCycle.js file
- It should execute after identifying defaulters but before finalizing the payout

### 8. Testing Scenarios
- Test with various community sizes
- Test with different numbers of defaulters
- Test with different backup fund percentages
- Test with backup fund at different levels (empty, partial, full)

## Next Steps
1. Implement the changes in handleUnreadyMidCycle.js
2. Create unit tests
3. Test in development environment
4. Document the new functionality
