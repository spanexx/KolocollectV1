# AWS SES Sandbox Mode Information

## Current Status

Your AWS SES account is currently in **sandbox mode**. This means:

✅ **Verified sender addresses:**

- <victorchideraani@gmail.com> (verified ✓)

❌ **Sandbox limitations:**

- Can only send emails TO verified email addresses
- Cannot send to arbitrary email addresses (like user registrations)
- Limited sending rate (200 emails per 24-hour period)

## Solutions

### Option 1: Request Production Access (Recommended)

1. Go to AWS SES Console: <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses/>
2. Navigate to "Account dashboard" → "Request production access"
3. Fill out the form with your use case:
   - **Email type:** Transactional
   - **Use case:** User registration welcome emails, community invitations, notifications
   - **Expected sending volume:** Start with 1000/day
   - **Compliance:** Mention you have proper unsubscribe mechanisms

### Option 2: Verify Test Email Addresses (Temporary)

For testing, you can verify additional email addresses:

1. Go to AWS SES Console → "Verified identities"
2. Click "Create identity"
3. Add: <spanexxvictor@gmail.com> (or any test email)
4. Check the verification email and click the link

### Option 3: Use SMTP Provider (Current Setup)

We've configured SMTP (Gmail) as the primary provider with these fixes:

- ✅ Fixed SSL certificate issues for Docker
- ✅ Fixed nodemailer method name
- ✅ Set SMTP as primary provider
- ✅ AWS SES as fallback for production

## Testing

Run this to test the current setup:

```bash
node test-welcome-email-fix.js
```

## Recommendation

Request production access for AWS SES since you have:

1. Valid business use case (savings platform)
2. Proper email templates
3. Verified sender domain/email
4. Good sending practices

This usually takes 24-48 hours to approve.
