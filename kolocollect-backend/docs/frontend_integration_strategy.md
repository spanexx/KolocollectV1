# Front-End Integration Strategy

## Component Structure
- **User Components**: 
  - **Modules**: 
    - FormsModule for handling forms.
    - HttpClientModule for API calls.
  - **Folder Structure**: 
    - `src/app/components/user/` for user-related components.
  - **Components**:
    - **User Registration Component**: Handles user sign-up, including form validation and submission.
    - **User Login Component**: Manages user authentication, including form handling and error messages.
    - **User Profile Component**: Displays user information and allows users to update their profiles (e.g., name, email).
    - **User Wallet Component**: Shows the user's wallet balance and transaction history, allowing for interactions related to contributions and payouts.
    - **User Settings Component**: Provides options for users to manage their account settings, such as changing passwords or notification preferences.
    - **User Notifications Component**: Displays notifications related to user activities, such as successful contributions or community updates.
    - **User Logout Component**: Handles user logout functionality, ensuring a smooth transition back to the login screen.

- **Community Components**: 
  - **Modules**: 
    - FormsModule for community creation forms.
  - **Folder Structure**: 
    - `src/app/components/community/` for community-related components.
    Alright, after reviewing the frontend integration document, here's how to structure the community components:

1. **Community Creation Form Component**: Handles new community setup with validation (name, rules, payout schedule). Integrates with POST /communities.

2. **Community List Component**: Displays all communities with search/filter. Uses GET /communities and CommunityService.

3. **Community Detail Component**: Shows members, contributions, metrics. Uses GET /communities/:id and related endpoints.

4. **Community Settings Component**: Manages metadata, permissions, payout config. Uses PATCH/DELETE /communities/:id.

5. **Community Members Component**: Manages member roles/approvals. Integrates with communityRoutes.js member endpoints.

6. **Community Contributions Feed**: Lists recent contributions with filters. Links to contributionUtils.js.

7. **Community Payouts Component**: Tracks distribution history and schedules. Uses payoutRoutes.js data.

Key integration points:
- CommunityService methods for API calls
- AuthGuard for protected routes
- Shared models for Community/Contribution interfaces

Folder structure:
```
src/app/components/community/
├── community-create/
├── community-list/
├── community-detail/
├── community-settings/
├── community-members/
├── community-contributions/
└── community-payouts/
```



- **Contribution Components**: 
    - ReactiveFormsModule for contribution forms.
  - **Folder Structure**: 
    - `src/app/components/contribution/` for contribution-related components.

read the contribution implementations in the back end to understand how to bring it to the front end. 
create a contribution service that serves the contribution routes make sure to provide all routes from the contributionRou

- **Payout Components**: 
  - **Modules**: 
    - HttpClientModule for payout management.
  - **Folder Structure**: 
    - `src/app/components/payout/` for payout-related components.

## State Management
- **Library**: NgRx
- **Modules**: 
  - StoreModule for state management.
  - EffectsModule for handling side effects.
- **Details**: 
  - Define actions for user authentication, community management, contributions, and payouts.
  - Create reducers to manage state changes.
  - Implement selectors for accessing state data.

## Routing
- **Routing Module Setup**: 
  - Define routes for user, community, contribution, and payout components.
  - Use route guards to protect routes that require authentication.
- **Lazy Loading**: 
  - Implement lazy loading for feature modules to optimize performance.

## Responsiveness
- **CSS Frameworks**: 
  - Use Bootstrap for grid layout and responsive design.
  - Use Angular Material for UI components.
- **Media Queries**: 
  - Implement custom styles using media queries for different screen sizes.

## API Integration
- **Service Layer Structure**: 
  - Create service classes for user, community, contribution, and payout management.
- **HTTP Interceptors**: 
  - Implement interceptors to manage authentication tokens and handle errors globally.

## User Experience
- **Form Validation**: 
  - Use Reactive Forms for user-friendly forms with validation.
- **Notification Libraries**: 
  - Use Angular Material Snackbar for user feedback on actions (e.g., success messages, error notifications).
