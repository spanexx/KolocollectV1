   Trigger: User account creation
   Template: Welcome email
   Recipients: New users

2. COMMUNITY CREATION
   File: kolocollect-backend/controllers/communityController.js
   Trigger: New community created
   Recipients: Community admin
   Purpose: Confirmation of community setup

3. MEMBER JOINING COMMUNITY
   File: kolocollect-backend/services/emailService.js
   Trigger: User joins a community

=============================================================

A. PASSWORD RESET REQUEST EMAIL
   Implementation Location: kolocollect-backend/controllers/userController.js (lines 542-548)
   Current Status: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Currently returns token in API response

   // For development, we'll return it in the response
   res.status(200).json({ 
     message: 'Password reset email has been sent.',
     resetToken // In production, this should be sent via email instead
   });
   ```
   
   Enhanced Code (Production):
   ```javascript
   // Send reset token via email
   const resetUrl = `${process.env.FRONTEND_URL}/reset-password?token=${resetToken}`;
   
   await emailService.sendPasswordResetEmail({
     recipient: user.email,
     resetToken: resetToken,
     resetUrl: resetUrl,
     userName: user.name,
     expirationTime: '1 hour'
   });

===============================================================================
                            DATABASE MODIFICATIONS
===============================================================================

USER MODEL ADDITIONS:
- emailPreferences object with notification settings
- lastEmailSent timestamp tracking
- emailFrequencyLimits to prevent spam

COMMUNITY MODEL ADDITIONS:
- emailSettings object with community-wide email preferences
- emailNotificationLog array for audit trail
- adminEmailOverrides for emergency contacts

NOTIFICATION LOG MODEL:
- Create new model to track all email notifications sent
- Include: recipient, type, timestamp, delivery status, template used

===============================================================================
                              TESTING STRATEGY
===============================================================================

UNIT TESTS:
- Test each email service method individually
- Mock email delivery for testing
- Validate template rendering with sample data

INTEGRATION TESTS:
- Test email triggers in complete user workflows
- Verify email preferences are respected
- Test email delivery failure handling

LOAD TESTS:
- Test bulk email sending for large communities
- Verify email queue processing under load
- Test email rate limiting functionality

===============================================================================
                            DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS
===============================================================================

AWS SES CONFIGURATION:
- Verify domain authentication for email sending
- Set up bounce and complaint handling
- Configure sending limits and rate controls

MONITORING:
- Set up email delivery tracking
- Monitor bounce rates and complaints
- Alert on email service failures

ROLLBACK PLAN:
- Feature flags for email notifications
- Ability to disable specific email types
- Fallback to in-app notifications only

===============================================================================
                        SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS FOR PASSWORD RESET
===============================================================================

IMMEDIATE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. NEVER return reset tokens in API responses in production
2. Use environment variables for frontend URL construction (FRONTEND_URL)
3. Implement rate limiting on password reset requests (max 3 per hour per email)
4. Log all password reset attempts for security auditing
5. Use HTTPS only for reset links
6. Set short expiration times (1 hour maximum)
7. Invalidate tokens after successful use
8. Send confirmation emails for successful password changes

CURRENT SECURITY ISSUE:
The requestPasswordReset controller currently returns the reset token in the 
API response for development purposes. This MUST be changed for production:

INSECURE (Current):
```javascript
res.status(200).json({ 
  message: 'Password reset email has been sent.',
  resetToken // SECURITY RISK - Remove in production
});
```

SECURE (Required):
```javascript
res.status(200).json({ 
  message: 'Password reset email has been sent. Please check your inbox.'
  // No token in response
});
```

===============================================================================
                                  CONCLUSION
===============================================================================

This comprehensive email notification plan ensures that all critical financial 
and operational events in the Kolocollect system are properly communicated to 
relevant stakeholders via email, enhancing user engagement and system 
transparency.

Key benefits of implementation:
- Improved user engagement and retention
- Reduced missed contributions through timely reminders
- Enhanced transparency in financial operations
- Better administrative oversight and control
- Proactive issue resolution through early alerts
- CRITICAL: Proper password reset security for production deployment

The phased implementation approach allows for gradual rollout while ensuring 
the most critical notifications are implemented first. Password reset email 
functionality should be implemented IMMEDIATELY as it's required for production 
security compliance.
