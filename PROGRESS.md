       1. Create base folder structure for new components:
  ```

          components/
            community/
              community-detail/                  (existing)

              community-tabs/
                community-overview/              (new)
                community-members/               (new)
                community-midcycle/              (new)
                community-contribution-history/  (new)
                community-votes/                 (new)

              shared-features/
                sharing-buttons/                 (new)
                midcycle-progress/               (new)
                vote-creation/                   (new)
                vote-list/                       (new)
                payout-info/                     (new)
          ```

       1. Update the CommunityDetailComponent to work as a container:

          - CommunityStateService with basic state
          - MidcycleStateService for tracking contributions
          - VotingStateService for vote management

       7. Update components to use state services:

    5. Added summary statistics view with key metrics
    6. Enhanced with transaction details view for individual contributions
  - Dependencies: Existing contribution and community endpoints
  - Completion date: May 10, 2025

## Highest Priority Tasks (May 9, 2025)

- [‚úÖ] **Critical Fix: User Communities Not Showing in Make Contribution Component**
  - Problem: The userCommunities array is empty because the members array in the Community model only contains references to Member documents, not the actual member details.
  - Solution: Updated the `loadUserCommunities()` method in make-contribution.component.ts to use the existing `/api/users/:userId/communities` endpoint from UserService instead of filtering communities locally.
  - Fixed on: May 9, 2025 - Improved community ID handling throughout the component to ensure consistent access

- [‚úÖ] **UI Fix: Community Dropdown Options Not Visible in Make Contribution Component**
  - Problem: The community options in the dropdown are showing up as plain white with no visible text.
  - Solution: Updated the component to normalize community data structure and ensure consistent property access, added specific styling to ensure dropdown text is visible with proper contrast.
  - Fixed on: May 9, 2025

- [‚úÖ] **Fix: 404 Error When Fetching Community Details**
  - Problem: The API call to fetch community details was failing with a 404 error due to ID mismatch. The community object has two different IDs: `_id` and a nested `id.id`, and the wrong one was being used.
  - Solution: Enhanced the normalization process to handle the nested ID structure and ensure the correct API ID is used when making calls to the backend. Added additional logging to help with future debugging.
  - Fixed on: May 9, 2025

- [‚úÖ] **Fix: Community Name Not Displayed Correctly in Dropdown**
  - Problem: Despite successful API responses, community names were still showing as "Unknown Community" in the dropdown.
  - Solution: Improved the community object normalization, fixed display name handling, added refresh mechanism to ensure the UI shows the correct community name from the API response, and enhanced debugging by adding detailed logging throughout the component.
  - Fixed on: May 9, 2025

- [‚úÖ] **Fix: 400 Bad Request Error When Making a Contribution**
  - Problem: The contribution API was returning a 400 Bad Request error because the midCycleId was missing or invalid when attempting to make contributions.
  - Solution: Implemented a robust midCycleId handling mechanism with several key improvements:
    1. Added a dedicated `processContribution()` method to ensure all required data is valid before making API calls
    2. Enhanced error handling with specific error messages based on response status and content
    3. Added additional validation for midCycle objects to ensure they always have valid IDs
    4. Implemented a retry mechanism to fetch community details when midCycleId is missing
    5. Improved debug logging throughout the contribution flow
  - Fixed on: May 9, 2025
